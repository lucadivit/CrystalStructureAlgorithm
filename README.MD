# Crystal Structure Algorithm

## Description
This repository contains my version of Crystal Structure Algorithm (CryStAl).
CryStAl is a nature inspired metaheuristic optimization method.

More in details this method is chiefly inspired by the principles underlying the formation of crystal structures from the addition of the basis to the lattice points,
which is a natural phenomenon that can be seen in the symmetric arrangement of constituents (i.e. atoms,
molecules, or ions) in crystalline minerals such as quartz.

For more information about it, you can read [this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351503962_Crystal_Structure_Algorithm_CryStAl_A_Metaheuristic_Optimization_Method)

## Notes
This code is written in  `python 3.11`. 

In order to install requirements type:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then you can run given example in `main.py` with the following command:

`python main.py`

Note that you if have either `python3` and `python2` on your system, you might need to use explicitly `python3` instead of `python` command.
